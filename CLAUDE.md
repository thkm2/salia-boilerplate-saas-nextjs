# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server (localhost:3000)
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) with React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: Better Auth (Google OAuth, Magic Link)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with CSS variables
- **UI**: shadcn/ui (new-york style) with Lucide icons
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Architecture Principles

This is a SaaS boilerplate. Follow these patterns:

### Philosophy: Essential Over Overkill
Keep it simple and production-ready. Write the minimum code needed. Optimize only when there's a real performance issue. Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.

### Data Flow Priority
1. **Server Components** - Default for all components
2. **Server Actions** - Primary data mutations, avoid API routes
3. **TanStack Query** - Only when client-side cache/sync is required
4. **Zustand** - Only for complex client state that can't be URL/server-driven

### Code Organization

**Core Principle: Colocation**
- Code specific to ONE route → Lives IN that route (`app/[route]/`)
- Code shared across 2+ routes → Lives in `/shared`
- Infrastructure (DB, Auth) → Lives in `/lib`

```

**Decision Tree:**
1. Used in 1 route? → `app/[route]/`
2. Infrastructure (DB/Auth)? → `lib/`
3. Shared business code? → `shared/`

**📖 For detailed architecture guidelines, see [md/ARCHITECTURE.md](md/ARCHITECTURE.md)**

### Auth vs Authorization Pattern
- **Auth** (`lib/auth/auth.ts`): Who is connected - Better Auth handles session
- **Session**: User data including id, role, plan, feature flags
- **Authorization** (`lib/auth/guards.ts`): Permission checks
  - `requireAuth()` - Throws if not authenticated
  - `requireRole("admin")` - Role-based access
  - `canAccessFeature("featureName")` - Feature flag check

### Roles & Plans
- **Roles**: `admin`, `user`, `beta` (stored in session)
- **Plans**: `free`, `basic`, `pro`, `admin` - Each with credit allocations

### Credits System
Credits are transactional with full audit trail:
- Each operation creates a transaction record (+X or -X)
- Never direct increment/decrement
- Examples: `upgrade_plan +100`, `feature_use -1`, `admin_grant +500`

### Feature Flags
- Per-user feature activation (beyond simple `beta` role)
- Admin panel for flag management
- Stored in user record, accessible in session

### Logging
No external logging packages. Only log:
- Errors
- Critical security events
Keep error handling precise and controlled.

## Path Aliases

```typescript
@/*               // src/*
@/shared/*        // src/shared/*
@/lib/*           // src/lib/*
```

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { grantCredits } from "@/shared/actions/credits"
import { db } from "@/lib/db"
import { Button } from "@/shared/components/ui/button"
```

## Adding shadcn Components

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```
